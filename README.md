# Complexity_Oslo_Model

Self-organised criticality (SOC) refers to the property of slowly-driven non-equilibrium systems with multiple degrees of freedom to self-organise into a highly susceptible state that
features scale-free invariance without the external fine-tuning of control parameters. In this project, SOC was investigated by simulating the avalanche dynamics of the slowly-driven onedimensional
ricepile experiment using the Oslo Model. The distinct characteristic of the model is that the threshold slope for a given site is randomly selected to be 1 or 2 every time it
relaxes. Despite its simplicity, this feature captures real life spatial and temporal fluctuations and displays SOC in the way that it spontaneously organises itself to a steady state and displays invariant avalanche-size probability
